## Introduction

Any given professional area has a certain type of problems that are not related with knowledge limits within,
but with comprehension and practical expertise. These issues are usually faced during the early stages of a career, 
and are more abundant the more heterogeneous the job is.

In this post I will explain how I have been facing these problem from my Computer Scientist perspective,
and what long term benefits I think we may be able to achieve from having the right attitude.


## Having the right attitude

### Hacking things

Computer Science, and programming in general, is one of the most heterogeneous jobs out there right now.
It is what allow us to have phones, computers, smart-cars, as long as the web, and everything that comes with it.
In order for a particular professional area to serve such a multipurpose variety of products, it must be flexible enough 
to allow different paradigms to emerge and evolve over time.

I am grateful to dedicate my time to work on this field, as I love what I do, and it allows me to think about the world
around me in an abstract way. Don't get my wrong, I am not talking about seeing everything around me as if 
I could code a _class_ out of it, I am not that nerd. I mean that, whenever I face minimally complex situations,
such as documents renewal processes, organization procedures within a given company, or defined
systems to structure knowledge (in a library, for instance), I do not treat them as day to day stuff.

I try to _hack_ them. I try to understand them as good as I can, to be able to correctly interact with them later on,
in my own benefit.

That's what I call the _hack_ attitude. An accessible mindset that everyone can have, but that is easier to get when
you boast both your curiosity and abstract thinking capabilities. Lucky for me, coding helps a lot on the second.

### Not letting go

Unfortunately, there is another side to the coin. Life is hard, problems can get complicated, and we may not be 
as intelligent as we thought we were. That's OK, it would be impossible to understand everything we are thrown into on our
first look. This is where the second part of the right attitudes emerges: resilience.

Resilience to keep looking, resilience to keep being curious, resilience to keep fighting that feeling telling us 
that we may never get our head around it... ultimately, resilience to let it go. This attitude can also be summarize
with the overused and cliche phrase of _"Never surrender"_, that people usually have in their Mr. Wonderful mugs.

In this particular case though, the _"not letting go"_ (a.k.a. _"never surrender"_) attitude is not going to be something
flashy and cool that you can take a picture of, and upload to Instagram. It is not going to be a physical act such as
finishing a hard marathon, getting the car you dreamed about, or getting a strong and fit body.

No, it won't be any of that.

It will just be a change in your mental model. A change on how you understand certain concepts, and the world around you.
It is not flashy and cool, I know, but it provides long term benefits that will be useful later on during our career,
so we will be thankful to have them in our personal toolkit.


### Long term benefits

The most direct benefit that you may get from this attitude will only appear after some time. This time depends on
your experiences, and how consistent you keep it throughout the earliest stages of your career, as well as your personal life.
In my case, it has been years until I have started to see the benefits, but it definitely varies from person to person.

So, what is it? what can you get out of it? Well, I would define it as the _"problem solver aura"_. It is something that
won't be appreciated by others right away, as it requires some complications along the way for it to arise,
but it will be one of your defining features for the people who spend enough time around you. You will become someone
who your colleagues will turn to when something is not going as planned, knowing that you may be able to offer a different
perspective over the situation, and hopefully, help fix it.

In summary, the _"problem solver status"_ allow us to properly face day to day problems without easy answers.

From my experience, these situations require a relative good amount of effort to overcome, and are not always rewarded.
However, we must as well consider that, if we have been cultivating the right attitude for long enough, we may be
one of the few individuals across our team who can solve them.


## The End Game

At the end of the day, people will be defined by their problem solving capabilities, more than what their CVs say.
It won't matter if they work at banking, designing or software development (like me), because their professional image
will be stronger as a multipurpose problem solver, than as a professional label ("designer", "engineer"...)

The end game implies reaching a point when, upon a certain problem, we do not ask ourselves whether we would be able to solve it,

But instead, if it is worth our time.
