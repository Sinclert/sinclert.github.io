## Intro
Around these dates, 2 years ago, I was flying to Geneva to join CERN Openlab program. 
At that time I did not quite know how my summer was going to be, and 
what I was throwing myself into. All I knew was that I felt excited, and ready 
to spend a great summer in Switzerland.

Looking back I must say it was an incredible experience.

This post is a summary of everything I experienced during July and August 2018, 
while being an intern on CERN Openlab program, at Switzerland. Everything from 
the country, to the way of living, CERN itself, the Openlab program, 
and the trips I made.


## What is CERN?
CERN is the _European Center for Nuclear Research_, and its name is the acronym
of its french name. It holds a place among the most prestige research institutions
on Earth, being top one when it comes to anything Physics related, as it has
the largest particle collider in the world, [the LHC][cern-lhc-facts], for detecting
new fundamental particles ‚öõÔ∏è.

![CERN LHC](/assets/images-posts/openlab/cern-lhc-tunnel.jpg)

LHC stands for _"Large Hadron Collider"_, a 27 kilometer tunnel between the borders
of France and Switzerland, used to collide near-speed-of-light particles at one
of the four detectors: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE or LHCb.

The LHC is a piece of engineering all human kind should feel proud of.

CERN is also famous for being [the birth place of the World Wide Web][cern-web-birth], 
thanks to Tim Berners-Lee in 1989; and the first touch display prototypes,
as explained in one of the site tours.


## What is the Openlab Program?

### Introduction
The Openlab program is a summer program launched by CERN happening every summer,
between July 1st and August 31st. It is an internship program where **Computer Science
graduate students** participate in research projects while attending a series of 
in-site lectures about CERN, and enjoying some alternative program activities.

The program offers students a very nice experience on cutting edge research
and projects from the inside, where they contribute to their assigned projects,
and prepare a summary report and presentation when reaching the end of the program.
Students do not choose the project they are assigned to, as Project Leaders 
are the ones taking interest and selecting particular students once they pass
an initial filter.

The _Openlab program_ is often confused with the _"[Summer Student program][cern-summer-plan]"_,
as they are very similar: both of them happen every summer, and both of them offer
internship positions to students. The main difference is that Openlab is centered on 
**Computer Science** students, offering only 40 spots, while the _Summer Student program_
offer between 150 and 200 spots, to students of all backgrounds.

The option to participate is open to people from around the world, and 
the application numbers are astonishing. In the 2018 edition, around
1,600 students applied, but only 40 of us were selected [(1)](#references).

![Openlab students](/assets/images-posts/openlab/openlab-students.jpg)

### Program logistics
Openlab students arrive at the beginning of July to start their internship program.
Before the start of the program, Openlab offers student the possibility to live in _Saint Genis_,
a french village just across the border north-west of CERN, or to search for their own residence.
I recommend accepting _Saint Genis_, as you will be living with most of the other
Openlab participants, and it is quite near CERN.

In addition, CERN has a bike renting program offering students and researchers
a free rental bike (only deposit). This is great to move around CERN campus, 
which has a large extension, and to commute from _Saint Genis_ to CERN faster üö≤.

Just a couple of advises here:

- Be sure to ask for a bike the moment you arrive, otherwise, you would need to wait
until other bikes get available. Bikes do not last more than a few days once
the Openlab and Summer programs start.

- Be sure to have a bike lock, and, as humanly possible, **always leave the bike inside CERN**.

To connect with the closest city, Geneva, and its main station, _Cornavin_,
there is a tram connecting CERN and Geneva, taking around 35 minutes.

### Program activities
The program offer three types of activities: lectures, tours and trips.

Lectures are spread along July and explain the basics of CERN, its experiments,
its infrastructure and the projects that are being carried out at that moment.
These lectures are some-how interesting as you discover some shocking facts about CERN.

For example, did you know that, because of the collisions, there are
**6 petabytes** of information being generated **per second**? [(2)](#references)
Or that there is a bigger collider being planned for 2040? [(3)](#references)

In addition, the Openlab Program organizes some CERN site tours. On the 2018 edition,
those tours took us to the visitors center, the [Antimatter Factory][cern-antimatter]
and to CERN Pr√©vessin campus, where the [Control Center][cern-control-center] is located.

![CERN control center](/assets/images-posts/openlab/cern-control-center.jpeg)

Finally, there are the trips.

The first one is an afternoon trip to Geneva, where there were a couple of activities
to get familiarized with the city, its lake, its old town district, and most of its cultural places.

The second trip is a weekend trip to Z√ºrich. This trip is more interesting than the first one,
as it includes some company offices tours (_Open-Systems_ and _IBM Thinklab_), as long as 
a visit to ETH Z√ºrich, one of the most prestigious universities in Europe.
There is additional free time to explore the city, so it is a good overall experience.

![IBM thinklab visit](/assets/images-posts/openlab/ibm-visit.jpg)


## My Openlab experience
As previously explained, Openlab interns are assigned to a wide variety of Software projects.
The overall experience that interns go through highly depends on their project and
their responsibilities. I had colleagues who were completely bored with what
they were working on, and some others who were lucky enough to end up in a well-designed,
well-suited project (as it was my case).

In general, interns have limited permissions, and their work progression is closely followed
by their project manager.

That being said, I remember a small incident where another Openlab student reconfigured
one of CERN main internal network switches, making part of the CERN campus to lose
internet connection for some hours. Be responsible, and never forget where you are.

### My Openlab project
In my particular case, I joined a project called [REANA][reana-web], under the IT-CDA-DR section.
_REANA_ stands for ‚Äú**Re**producible **Ana**lysis‚Äù, and it is an open source project
intertwine with [CERN Analysis Preservation][cern-preservation-web] initiative.

The main goal of REANA is to create a platform where researchers could define
and preserve analysis on big volumes of data, making them reproducible.
This has been a [long problem in research][nature-reproducibility-paper], where
trying to replicate the data analysis other scientists performed is tedious.
Making science reproducible also addresses the case of cherry picking results
when there are particular interests or bias.

Internally, REANA is composed by a set of Python microservices that are executed in
a coordinated manner. The platform is designed to support different storage technologies,
different workflow specification languages (_Yadage_ and _Common Workflow Language_, CWL),
and for now one back-end engine: _Kubernetes_.

![REANA front page](/assets/images-posts/openlab/reana-front-page.png)

My role within the team was to **create the initial version of a new component: the User Interface**.
REANA did not have a graphical UI at that time, only a terminal one. My job was to design 
a working prototype from scratch, connecting it to the back-end server so analysis information
could be shown on browser interfaces.

It was during my work on REANA when I learned frameworks such as _React_, _Redux_,
and _SemanticUI_; in addition to the agile development methodology, good practices
for open source software, due to the stand ups that we had every day. On top of that,
I deepened my understanding of GIT and Python, and I started to learn _Docker_ and _Kubernetes_.

I learned a lot, and I had Tibor, Diego and Dinos to thank for that.

If you are curious, [REANA is still under active development][reana-repo] and
is gaining maturity day after day. It is currently near version 0.7.0,
being already deployed in different cluster around the world. I know it got deployed
at CERN, at the University of Chicago, and very soon at the Brooklyn National Laboratory.

My project report and final presentation can be found on _Indico_ by the name:
_‚ÄúREANA, to reproducibility‚Ä¶ and beyond!‚Äù_ ([available here][reana-presentation]),
title which got reused in 2019 by the next REANA intern.

### The Webfest hackathon
CERN organises a hackathon called _Webfest_ every summer, open to both Openlab
and Summer student participants. It is hold around the end of July, and lasts a full weekend.

It is a nice experience to get close to your Openlab colleagues, and to meet new people.
Indeed, CERN encourages past editions participants that may be around to serve as mentors
for the new hackathon edition.

My friends and I decided to create an event platform that could supplement _Indico_
(a CERN developed project), with a clear focus on geolocation and attendance control.
We wanted to create a platform where real-time information could be shared between 
organisers and attendees so that they could better estimate what part of their audience
was running late, what part was lost trying to locate the correct space and 
what part was already on the event location.

We called it _‚ÄúCERN-Connect‚Äù_.

The official story was that the project was named after the functionality it provided,
as it connects event organizers and attendees, but that is only half the story...
Around that time, there was a video about a brand new cryptocurrency gaining popularity.
On that video, the company representative was making absurd claims about how their
cryptocurrency would _safe the world_.... It was called [Bit-Connect][bit-connect-wiki].

We ended up [**winning the hackathon**][webfest-2018-winners] üèÜ

We liked memes, and hidden references even more...

![Webfest hackathon](/assets/images-posts/openlab/webfest-hackathon.jpeg)

### My CERN impressions
Overall, CERN seemed like an amazing place because of the people you can meet there.
It is common for employees to have 2 or 3 year contracts, and go back to Industry 
or research facilities afterwards, so there is always a good mixture of backgrounds.

In terms of facilities, I was surprised of how _plain_ over-ground offices looked.
I was expecting some cutting edge infrastructures and breath-taking work spaces,
given the budget CERN has. Nothing further from reality. I got the impression that
the breath taking places were all placed underground, on restricted areas like the LHC tunnel,
which we as Openlab interns were not allow to visit.

However, there were others over-ground facilities that cached my attention:
the indoors particle accelerators. Those accelerators are smaller than the underground ones
and serve as initial thrusters to help particles reach high speeds before entering the big ones.
These indoors accelerators are wrapped in huge concrete blocks (~125 cubic meters)
to prevent radiation from leaking.

![CERN infrastructure](/assets/images-posts/openlab/cern-infrastructure.jpeg)

Truly, [those indoors facilities were places of pure engineering][cern-indoors-experiments].
The number of servers, cables, concrete blocks, nitrogen pipes, and other electrical
and mechanical material was out of the charts. It is, up to date, the most **human-made** 
breath-taking place I have ever been. And we didn‚Äôt even go under-ground...


## How is Switzerland?
One of the most important parts of the Openlab experience is to live far from home,
share the experience with your fellow interns, and enjoy one of the most beautiful
countries on Earth, Switzerland.

### Landscapes
Switzerland landscapes highly depend on the part of the country you are visiting.
CERN is located near Geneva, on the South-West part of the country, in what 
is called the ‚Äúfrench area‚Äù. For this reason, most of the people speaks French natively.
The French area, covering the surroundings of the L√©man lake is a peaceful area 
where rivers and lakes are interspersed with green meadows and forests.

Then there are the Alps.

The Alps are home to the highest mountain of all Europe, the _Mont Blanc_ (technically
in France territory), and the biggest glacier of all Europe, near _Jungfrau_ mountain.
Both _Mont Blanc_ and _Jungfrau_ will be covered later on this post.

### Daily life
On more practical matters, Switzerland uses its own currency, the Swiss Franc (CHF),
although accepts Euro in most of their territory. Francs are a bit less valuable
than the Euro, but the price of living is quite high. I would say almost double
to my home country, Spain.

The climate is usually smooth, although it can reach quite extreme temperatures,
both in Winter and Summer, given that the whole country is far from big volumes of water.

Regarding food, cheese and chocolate are the kings of the land. Cheese dishes
such as [_Fondue_][swiss-fondue-wiki] and [_Raclette_][swiss-fondue-wiki] can be found 
in almost any restaurant, being the most typical and delicious in Swiss gastronomy.
Then there is the chocolate: Switzerland is also famous for its sweets and chocolate bars.
Indeed, there are plenty of chocolate factories throughout its territory, producing 
sugar products that are exported all over the world. _Lindt_, _Milka_, _Nestle_,
_Cailler_, _Toblerone_... all Swiss. üç´


## Summer trips
Outside work, my experience during the summer of 2018 was also defined by
the trips and the experiences that we, Openlab colleagues, lived together.

During the two months period we were living in Switzerland, we travelled a lot.
I would say that 7 out of 9 weekends we rented a car and drove somewhere far from Geneva.
The remaining ones were spent there, as it is a wonderful place to go swimming 
and kayaking on its lake.

### Geneva
Geneva was the closest city to where we lived, and the place where we spent
most of our time outside work. The city is placed around one of the corners of L√©man Lake,
and it has 2 crossing rivers, dividing the city into 3 main sections.

It is the place where _United Nations_, the _World Trade Consortium_, the _World Health Organization_
and so many other international organizations place their headquarters.
It is also home to famous sculptures like the Broken Chair or the Reformation Wall;
and important buildings like _Saint Pierre Cathedral_, which can be entered and visited
to get an incredible view of Geneva and its lake.

Nevertheless, the most iconic places for me were the _Jet d‚ÄôEau_, a water jet
reaching 140 meters high; _Bains de Paquis_, a lake beach with some restaurants
and a couple of structures to jump into the lake; and _The Junction_,
the point where Geneva rivers merge, mixing waters and providing some
majestic pictures from the bridge next to it. Of course, people can also swim there üòÑ

![Geneva Jonction](/assets/images-posts/openlab/geneva-jonction.png)

Finally, another point of interest is the _Parc de la Grange_, where they lit
dozens of bonfires on August 1st to celebrate Switzerland National Holiday.
If you are visiting Geneva around those dates, do not miss it!

### Montreux
Montreux is a small town placed at the other side of L√©man lake. It is a relaxing place
where people go to do hiking, or visit _Ch√¢teau de Chillon_, a famous lakeside castle.

I got the impression that Montreux is a bit of a hippie town, because of the vintage LP
shops I found along the way, its Pop icons statues (like Freddie Mercury),
and the Jazz music festival happening there early July.

![Montreux shop](/assets/images-posts/openlab/montreux-shop.jpeg)


In addition, there are multiple places offering paragliding jumps, something that
me and my friends gathered the courage to try. I am glad I did it, paragliding over
L√©man lake was quite the experience.

![Montreux paragliding](/assets/images-posts/openlab/montreux-paragliding.jpg)

### Lyon & the World Cup Final
2018 was a football World Cup year. I followed the games during some weeks,
and got mixed feelings when I saw France reaching the final. On one hand,
I would rather have Spain there; on the other hand, I knew living a World Cup final
inside one of the countries that participate was going to be special ‚öΩ.

With that in mind, some Openlab friends and I got a train to Lyon on July 14th.
We visited Lyon as an excuse to live the final from [_Place Bellecour_][place-bellecour-wiki]:
a large square at the center of Lyon, where screens were going to be placed the next day,
July 15th, for the World Cup Final.

The first day, we visited Lyon old town between the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne rivers,
_Saint-Jean Baptiste_ Cathedral, _Notre Dame_ basilica (after taking a cable car to reach it),
and the Botanic Garden, within the _Parc de la T√™te d‚ÄôOr_.

![Lyon river](/assets/images-posts/openlab/lyon-river.jpeg)

On the day of the event, it was hard to think about anything else: people were starting 
to warm up for the game, chants of **Allez le bleu!** were flooding the streets,
and public transport was unusable.

Finally, France won, and craziness started...

### Chamonix & Aiguille du Midi
Chamonix is a french village at one hour car from Geneva, the closest to
[Aiguille du Midi][aiguille-du-midi-wiki]: a very high lookout from which, if the day is clear, 
visitors can see the **Mont Blanc**, the tallest mountain in Europe.

Taking the cable car to _Aiguille du Midi_ is a unique experience. First, because
it is about 110 CHF, and secondly, because it takes you up the slope of some mountains 
where you will wonder how it was humanly possible to build anything there.
At least that is what I was thinking.

Clearly worth the 110 francs.

![Aiguille du Midi](/assets/images-posts/openlab/aiguille-du-midi.jpg)

### Z√ºrich
At some point around late July and early August, Openlab organised the trip to Z√ºrich.
It was a trip where we visited some companies headquarters, attended some ad-hoc
_ETH Z√ºrich_ lectures, and walk central Z√ºrich streets following a guided tour.

Z√ºrich is located in what is commonly known as the _‚ÄúGerman area‚Äù_, the North-East part of Switzerland.
Indeed, most of the street signs and local advertisements were written in german.

Overall, we had very limited time to explore the city as it deserved, but it was enough
to get the vibe of it. My impression was that Z√ºrich is a more serious city than Geneva:
there is more industry, and authorities are less permissive with people swimming in their lake.

### Zermatt
Zermatt is a colourful swiss village traversed by the _Matter Vispa_ river,
located at the feet of [Matterhorn peak][matterhorn-peak-wiki] (the mountain on
the Toblerone chocolate bars).

It is a very special place, as it is not reachable by car (by a non-electric car, at least).
The city is declared as [_zero emissions area_][zermatt-eco-web], and can only be traversed
by electric cars or walking. In order to reach it, we needed to leave the car on T√§sh,
the closest city North from it, and take a connecting train to Zermatt.

### Interlaken & Jungfrau
Finally, in late August, we rented a car and took a weekend trip to Interlaken.
Interlaken is one of the most famous villages around the world, and its name does not lie:
it is small village placed between two crystal-clear and cold water lakes.
_Brienz_ to the East and _Thun_ to the West.

![Interlaken selfie](/assets/images-posts/openlab/interlaken-selfie.jpg)

Near Interlaken, up the slope of a mountain, are the _Saint Beatus_ caves.
They are old and humid caves where stalactites and stalagmites has been form for thousands of years.

Interlaken on itself does not have that much to offer apart from its outstanding beauty,
which you can find looking around in any place of Switzerland. For this reason,
we decided to stay the night at _Grindelwald_, a tiny village near Interlaken,
so that we could visit [Jungfrau][jungfrau-web] the next morning.

Jungfrau was the main course of the weekend, and we needed to rest properly to enjoy it:
We took the Grindelwald LGP cable car, and stayed the night at a cheap hostel up the mountain.
We were interns after all...

Next morning we drove to _Lauterbrunnen_ and took a train to Jungfrau (_"Top of Europe"_).
I must say that train ticket prices are around 100 francs, but they get cheaper the earlier
you take the train. We were there first thing in the morning. The train climbed slowly while
showing us **beautiful valleys and mountains along the way**. The trip is around one hour long,
so relax and enjoy the ride.

Finally, we reached Jungfrau peak, and our excitement was over the sky.
There is a huge lookout with many exits directly into snow areas where people can enjoy snow,
while having the biggest glacier in Europe as landscape. üèîÔ∏è

![Jungfrau glacier](/assets/images-posts/openlab/jungfrau-glacier.jpg)

This [video makes more justice to the experience][jungfrau-video].


## Curiosities
There are dozens of curious facts about CERN and my Openlab experience that
have been set aside through this post. Here is a collection of the most interesting ones. 

### The summer student temple
One of the most preserved secrets of Openlab and CERN as a whole is the location
of the _Summer Student Temple_. It is supposed to be located within a network of
maintenance tunnels below some of CERN buildings.

Me and some other Openlab colleagues entered the tunnels a couple of times with,
but we were unable to find it. **The tunnels are endless!** If you find yourself
as an Openlab or Summer Student any time in the future, ask other people about the temple.
You will hear incredible stories, and find relevant information to your own search.

### CERN experiments separation
I explained before how CERN LHC infrastructure has 4 critical points where collisions
can occur: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb. For each of those places, there is an _"experiment"_.
Each experiment has its own rules, and a different type of detector, so they can
wide the search for new elemental particles.

What is surprising, and this is something I learned long after my Openlab experience,
is that scientists participating at different experiments are not supposed to discuss
ideas together. This _policy_ is supposed to help reduce the bias scientists apply to 
their simulations and analysis across _experiments_.

### Geneva silent party
At some point during the summer of 2018, Geneva launched a [_silent party_][silent-party-wiki]
on _Rousseau island_. The location changes year after year, but I believe they do it every summer.

I had never attended a silent party before, and it was one of the coolest experiences I had.
If you was wondering what a silent party is, it is basically a space where attendees
are handed bluetooth headphones connected to X different music frequencies.
Each frequency makes the headphones light up in a particular color, and play a specific type of music.

That‚Äôs the magic: there is almost silence around you, but music plays in your headphones,
while being surrounded by hundreds of other people with similar headphones,
listening to the same music you are, and dancing to their best. üéß

### Summer competitions
Throughout the summer, there were a couple of Openlab-promoted competitions taking place:
the _Webfest hackathon_, at the end of July; and the _end-of-project presentations_,
at the end of August.

Regarding the _Webfest hackathon_, we were rewarded with a bag of CERN goodies:
portable batteries, stickers, notebooks... and a CERN helmet!
Yes, that is right. A yellow helmet with the blue CERN logo on it.

Turns out my end-of-project presentation was ranked 2nd best, so I got a second bag of CERN items,
very similar to the first one I had received. I was the only person from all Openlab 2018
to earn two prizes that summer, and I really think my presentation did not deserve 2nd place.

Finally, I decided to give most of my second bag of items away to some of my Openlab friends.
The helmet went to [Leonardo Kuffo][leonardo-twitter], one of my best Openlab friends,
who did an outstanding end-of-project presentation.

## Final thoughts
Thank you for reading.

If you have reached this far into the post you could be thinking: _how could you do
all of this in just two months?_ Well, I am still asking myself that question.
I will always remember that wonderful summer and all the friends I did along the way.

It was one of the most exhausted periods of my life, for good reasons.
It was all the learning, travelling, trying and falling, flying (literally),
and wonder what made my 2018 summer ‚ò∫Ô∏èÔ∏è.

_An Openlab experience_.
