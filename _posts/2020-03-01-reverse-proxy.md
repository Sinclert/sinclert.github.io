## Introduction

Even after some years dedicating myself to software engineering,
and having a relatively good understanding of big applications component architectures,
there was a specific resource that I could not get my head around. At least until recent months.

I am referring to what gets called _"Reverse Proxy"_.

In this post I will get into the details of what it is, where its name comes from,
and the common misunderstanding around this specific resource.


## A nomenclature nightmare

In order to clearly understand what people refer to when they talk about _"Reverse Proxy"_, 
it is better to start by looking at the big picture when considering a big software application, 
and its relationship with the network
(or how [Moss refers to it at _"IT Crowd"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg): _"The Internet"_).

The architecture would contain (from left to right):
- A set of clients (web, mobile apps...).
- An optional _"Proxy"_ that some clients may decide to use.
- _"The Internet"_ (usually represented by a cloud).
- Some sort of _"Load Balancer"_ to distribute requests.
- A set of server replicas.

Ok, I will stop right here.

You may be thinking: _Ok, so, you are trying to explain what a "Reverse proxy" is,
and this article has only named "Proxies" and "Load Balancers". Where are the "Reverse proxies"?_

The _"Reverse Proxy"_ architecture location, and the reason why it has that name,
are hidden in the previous list of network-related components, even though 
they are not obvious at first sight. **This is why the section is called nomenclature nightmare**. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 


## Reverse Proxy: what is it

A _"Reverse Proxy"_ is defined as:

_"A Type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers, implementing several
functionalities such as: caching, contents compression, distribution of requests, and / or security procedures"._

Following the definition, _"Reverse Proxy"_ is what lays between _"The Internet"_ and the set of servers replicas.
However, the component placed in that spot during the components listing was previous referred to as _"Load Balancer"_.
**Well, a _"Load Balancer"_ is nothing more than a sub-type of _"Reverse Proxy"_**, that only implements 
one of its functionalities: redistribution of request among several server replicas.

Therefore, we can conclude that a Reverse Proxy is a **generic figure**, referring to a network component placed
between _"The Internet"_ and the set of servers, implementing some of its original functionalities.


## Reverse Proxy: the misunderstandings

### The 'reverse' word

A common misunderstanding surrounding the term comes from the usage of the _"reverse"_ word in its name.
This word is very confusing as it is not clear what _"reverse"_ refers to, in order to be considered that way.

The word "reverse" refers to the fact that these components are placed in the opposite / reverse position,
**with respect to _"The Internet"_**, than the regular "Proxy". That is not that obvious at plain sight,
but it may become a bit more clear just by changing the very generic "Proxy" name, by _"Forward Proxy"_.
Now we are talking.

### The hidden presence

Another root of confusion is the fact that, even if the _"Reverse Proxy"_ figure is usually present in big scale
application diagrams, it is hard to find references to it in some orchestrator systems used nowadays.

Just consider Kubernetes, and its [services documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
Kubernetes gives developers a very easy way of deploying _"Load Balancers"_, as it is one of the native subtypes of "services"
that it provides. However, the term _"Reverse Proxy"_ is **only mentioned one time in the whole documentation**,
making hard to realize that some services available to deploy, are just sub-types of a bigger general figure
called _"Reverse Proxy"_.


## Conclusion

Given the previous explanations, the original list of network-related components in a big application diagram
can be decoded into the following:

- A set of clients (web, mobile apps...).
- An optional **_"Forward Proxy"_** that some clients may decide to use.
- _"The Internet"_ (usually represented by a cloud icon).
- A **_"Reverse Proxy"_** (probably a _Load Balancer_) to distribute requests.
- A set of server replicas.
