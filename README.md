# Personal blog

This repository contains my personal blog, created using Jekyll for the content management,
and GitHub pages for the blog hosting. A complete guide on how to do set it up can be found
at [this GitHub tutorial][github-pages-jekyll].

For more detailed information about how you can make your blog looks different (apply a theme),
or how the GitHub pages hosting can be integrated with project-specific websites, check out
my [very first blog post][blog-setting-up-post].

The blog is available on [sinclert.github.io/blog][blog-url].
