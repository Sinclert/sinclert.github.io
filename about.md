<p>
I work as a Research Software Engineer at the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu">Center for Data Science</a> in the New York University.
I have previously worked as Data Engineer at a spanish start-up called <a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a>, and as 
an Openlab intern at <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a> (Switzerland), helping on the <a href="http://www.reana.io">REANA</a> project.
</p>

<p>
My interests verse on software engineering, data pipelines, system scalability and devops.
I have experience with different languages such as Python, Java, Golang, SQL, JavaScript or HTML/CSS;
and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Spark / Beam, Prometheus, React, Git or C.I. tooling.

In this blog you will find posts mainly on software topics, but also on science and personal-organization.
