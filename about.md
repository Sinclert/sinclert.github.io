![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I am a Senior Software Engineer working at [Shopify][shopify-web]'s Infrastructure team.
Previously, I worked on the High Energy Physics (HEP) ecosystem as a Research Engineer
within the NYU [Center for Data Science][nyu-cds-web] and [CERN][cern-web] Openlab Program.

My interests verse on software engineering, data pipelines, cloud infrastructure and tooling.
My experience covers languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, Golang, SQL, JavaScript or HTML/CSS;
and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Spark / Beam, Prometheus, React, GIT or C.I. systems.

In this blog you will find posts mainly on software topics, but also on science and personal-organization.
