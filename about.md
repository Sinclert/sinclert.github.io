![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I am a Software Engineer working at the [Center for Data Science][nyu-cds-web] in New York University.
Previously, I worked as Data Engineer at a mobility start-up called [Cabify][cabify-web] and as
an Openlab Summer Student intern at [CERN][cern-web] (Switzerland), contributing to the [REANA][reana-web] project.

My interests verse on software engineering, data pipelines, cloud infrastructure and tooling.
My experience covers languages such as Python, Java, Golang, SQL, JavaScript or HTML/CSS;
and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Spark / Beam, Prometheus, React, GIT or C.I. systems.

In this blog you will find posts mainly on software topics, but also on science and personal-organization.
